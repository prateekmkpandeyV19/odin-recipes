        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>As far as fall baking goes, there are other flavors that hog the limelight (we're looking at you, pumpkin spice!).</p>
        <p>The humble persimmon is oft forgotten, except by those who already love its honey-like flavor and know that it is only available to enjoy during a short season.</p>
        <p>Persimmon bread is the perfect easy recipe to make with a surplus of persimmon pulp. Using extra ripe hachiya persimmons, the sweet flesh is easy to scoop away from the persimmon skin with a spoon.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 cup persimmon pulp</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped walnuts</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ cup raisins</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather ingredients. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x4-inch pan.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, cinnamon, salt, nuts, and raisins in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Blend eggs, sugar, and oil in a large bowl. Stir baking soda into persimmon pulp until well blended; add to sugar mixture.</li>
            <li>Fold in flour mixture. Pour batter into prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
